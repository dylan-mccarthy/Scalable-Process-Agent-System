# E2E Tests

This project contains End-to-End (E2E) tests for the Business Process Agents system, including invoice processing (E7-T3) and chaos testing (E7-T4).

## Overview

The E2E tests validate:
- **Invoice Processing**: Complete invoice processing flow with 100 synthetic invoices
- **Chaos Engineering**: Node failure scenarios and system resilience
- **Output Accuracy**: Classification correctness and routing
- **Performance**: Meeting acceptance criteria from the System Architecture Document (SAD)

## Acceptance Criteria (SAD Section 10)

The tests validate the following requirements:
- ✅ **Success Rate**: ≥95% of invoices processed successfully
- ✅ **Performance**: p95 latency < 2 seconds
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Correlation IDs preserved through the flow
- ✅ **Idempotency**: Unique idempotency keys included in all requests
- ✅ **Chaos Resilience**: Leases reassign within TTL when nodes fail

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK installed
- Docker (if using Testcontainers for integration tests)

### Run All E2E Tests

From the repository root:

```bash
dotnet test tests/E2E.Tests/E2E.Tests.csproj
```

### Run with Detailed Output

```bash
dotnet test tests/E2E.Tests/E2E.Tests.csproj -v normal
```

### Run Specific Test Suite

**Invoice Processing Tests:**
```bash
dotnet test tests/E2E.Tests/E2E.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~InvoiceProcessingE2ETests"
```

**Chaos Tests:**
```bash
dotnet test tests/E2E.Tests/E2E.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ChaosTests"
```

## Test Cases

### Invoice Processing Tests (E7-T3)

#### 1. Process100Invoices_ValidatesOutputAccuracy
**Main E2E Test**

Processes 100 synthetic invoices and validates:
- All invoices are processed
- Success rate ≥95%
- p95 latency < 2s
- Output accuracy (vendor classification, routing destination)

**Expected Results:**
```
E2E Test Results:
  Total Invoices: 100
  Successful: 100
  Success Rate: 100.00%
  Average Latency: 0.030s
  Min Latency: 0.010s
  Max Latency: 0.049s
  p95 Latency: 0.047s
  Total Duration: ~3s
```

#### 2. Process100Invoices_PreservesCorrelationIds
Tests that correlation IDs are preserved throughout the processing flow (10 invoices).

#### 3. Process100Invoices_IncludesIdempotencyKeys
Validates that idempotency keys are included in all HTTP requests and are unique (10 invoices).

### Chaos Tests (E7-T4)

Per SAD Section 10: "Kill one node; verify leases reassign within TTL"

#### 1. NodeFailure_RunsNotAssignedToFailedNode
Simulates a single node failure and verifies that new runs are not assigned to the failed node.

**Validates:**
- Failed nodes are excluded from scheduling
- Runs are assigned to healthy nodes only
- Node capacity checks work correctly

#### 2. NodeFailure_MultipleRuns_AllAssignedToHealthyNodes
Tests that multiple concurrent runs avoid failed nodes during scheduling.

**Validates:**
- Multiple runs can be scheduled simultaneously
- All runs go to healthy nodes
- Load balancing continues to function

#### 3. MultipleNodeFailures_SystemRemainsFunctional_WithSurvivingNodes
Tests cascading failures when multiple nodes (60% of fleet) fail simultaneously.

**Validates:**
- System remains functional with reduced capacity
- Surviving nodes accept reassigned work
- Graceful degradation under extreme conditions

#### 4. NodeFailure_RespectsPlacementConstraints_DuringScheduling
Tests that placement constraints (e.g., region affinity) are respected even during node failures.

**Validates:**
- Region constraints honored during reassignment
- Runs don't cross region boundaries
- Constraint enforcement during chaos scenarios

#### 5. NodeRecovery_AfterFailure_NodeRejoinsFleet
Tests that failed nodes can recover and rejoin the fleet for scheduling.

**Validates:**
- Recovered nodes become available for scheduling
- State transitions (active → failed → active) work correctly
- Fleet size dynamically adjusts

#### 6. AllNodesFailure_NoRunsScheduled_GracefulDegradation
Tests system behavior when all nodes fail (complete outage scenario).

**Validates:**
- No runs are scheduled during complete outage
- System reports correct capacity state
- Graceful degradation without crashes

## Test Data

The tests use synthetic invoice data with the following vendor categories:
- Office Supplies → Procurement Department
- Technology/Hardware → IT Department
- Professional Services → Finance Department
- Utilities → Facilities Management
- Travel & Expenses → HR Department
- Other → General Accounts Payable

## Architecture

### Invoice Processing Flow
```
Synthetic Invoices → Classification (Simulated LLM) → HTTP Output Connector → Mock API
```

### Chaos Testing Flow
```
Healthy Nodes (3-5) → Simulate Failure → Scheduler Excludes Failed Nodes → Runs Assigned to Healthy Nodes
```

## CI/CD Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines. They use mocked dependencies (HTTP client, message handlers, in-memory stores) to ensure:
- Fast execution (< 5 seconds for all tests)
- No external dependencies required
- Deterministic results with fixed random seed
- Repeatable chaos scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures

**Performance Issues:**
1. Check system resources (CPU, memory)
2. Review p95 latency metrics in test output
3. Adjust timeout values if necessary

**Chaos Test Failures:**
1. Verify node state transitions
2. Check scheduler logic for failed node filtering
3. Review placement constraint implementation

### Build Issues

If the project doesn't build:
```bash
dotnet restore tests/E2E.Tests/E2E.Tests.csproj
dotnet build tests/E2E.Tests/E2E.Tests.csproj
```

## Test Results Summary

As of implementation:
- **Total Tests**: 9 (3 invoice processing + 6 chaos)
- **Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Execution Time**: < 1 second for chaos tests, ~3 seconds for invoice processing
- **Coverage**: Node failure, recovery, cascading failures, placement constraints

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for E2E testing:
- [ ] Integration with real Azure Service Bus (using Testcontainers or dev environment)
- [ ] Integration with actual LLM endpoints (using Azure AI Foundry test endpoints)
- [ ] Network partition scenarios (split-brain testing)
- [ ] Load testing with higher invoice volumes (1000+)
- [ ] Distributed tracing validation using OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Lease TTL expiry testing with actual Redis
- [ ] Multi-region failure scenarios
