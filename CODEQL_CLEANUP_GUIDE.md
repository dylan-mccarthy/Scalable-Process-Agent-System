# CodeQL Alert Cleanup Summary

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Issue**: 360 open CodeQL alerts, but most reference non-existent files

## Problem Identified

Your repository shows **360 open CodeQL security alerts**, but investigation reveals:

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Total Open Alerts** | 360 | - |
| **Stale Alerts (non-existent files)** | 220 | ❌ Need dismissal |
| **Valid Alerts (actual source code)** | 140 | ✅ Need remediation |
| **Fixed Alerts** | 2 | ✅ Already resolved |

## Root Cause

CodeQL scanned more than just your source code:

### 1. Docker Container Scans (154 alerts)
**Files**: `dylan-mccarthy/scalable-process-agent-system/control-plane` and `node-runtime`

These alerts came from scanning **compiled Docker container images** instead of source code. When you build Docker images, CodeQL scanned the running containers or image layers.

**Why this happened**: Your CI/CD pipeline likely runs CodeQL after building containers, and it picked up code inside the containers.

### 2. Build Artifacts (62 alerts)
**Files**: `src/*/obj/Release/net9.0/...`

These are **auto-generated files** from .NET compilation:
- `Protos/LeaseService.cs` (30 alerts) - gRPC generated code
- `LeaseService.cs` (29 alerts) - gRPC client/server code  
- `RegexGenerator.g.cs` (3 alerts) - C# source generator output

**Why this happened**: CodeQL scanned the `obj/` build output folders.

### 3. Node.js Dependencies (2 alerts)
**Files**: `usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/...`

These are **npm package files** from the admin-ui or container Node.js installation.

**Why this happened**: CodeQL scanned node_modules or container filesystem.

### 4. Container Runtime Paths (2 alerts)
**Files**: `app/ControlPlane.Api.deps.json`, `app/Node.Runtime.deps.json`

These are **.NET dependency manifests** from inside running containers (`/app` folder).

**Why this happened**: CodeQL scanned container filesystem at runtime.

## Solution

### Step 1: Dismiss Stale Alerts

Run the provided cleanup script:

```powershell
.\dismiss-stale-alerts.ps1
```

This will:
- ✅ Dismiss all 220 stale alerts with appropriate reasons
- ✅ Preserve the 140 legitimate source code alerts
- ✅ Show progress and summary

**Estimated time**: 2-3 minutes (with API rate limiting)

### Step 2: Prevent Future Stale Alerts

Update your CodeQL configuration to exclude these paths:

Create `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`:

```yaml
name: "CodeQL Config"

paths-ignore:
  # Exclude build artifacts
  - '**/obj/**'
  - '**/bin/**'
  
  # Exclude Node modules
  - '**/node_modules/**'
  - 'usr/local/lib/**'
  
  # Exclude container paths
  - 'app/**'
  
  # Exclude Docker image paths
  - 'dylan-mccarthy/**'

paths:
  # Only scan actual source code
  - 'src/**'
  - 'tests/**'
  - '.github/**'

queries:
  - uses: security-and-quality
```

Then update `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Initialize CodeQL
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
  with:
    languages: csharp
    queries: security-and-quality
    config-file: .github/codeql/codeql-config.yml  # Add this line
```

### Step 3: Re-analyze Remaining Alerts

After cleanup, re-run the alert analysis to categorize the 140 valid alerts:

```powershell
# Refresh alert data
gh api --paginate "/repos/dylan-mccarthy/Scalable-Process-Agent-System/code-scanning/alerts?per_page=100&state=open" --jq '.[] | {number, rule: .rule.id, file: .most_recent_instance.location.path, line: .most_recent_instance.location.start_line}' > valid-alerts.json

# Group by rule
Get-Content valid-alerts.json | ConvertFrom-Json | Group-Object rule | Select-Object Name, Count | Sort-Object Count -Descending
```

This will give you the **actual** code quality issues to address.

## Expected Outcome

After running the cleanup:

```
Before:  360 open alerts (220 stale + 140 valid)
After:   140 open alerts (all valid source code issues)
Cleanup: 220 alerts dismissed with reasons
```

The 140 remaining alerts will be legitimate code quality issues in your actual source files that should be addressed through the security remediation plan.

## Why GitHub Didn't Auto-Close These

GitHub CodeQL **does not automatically close alerts** when:
- Files are deleted from the repository
- Files are in ignored paths (gitignore)
- Alerts are from previous scans of different file paths

You must manually dismiss stale alerts or configure exclusions to prevent them.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `dismiss-stale-alerts.ps1` to clean up 220 stale alerts
2. ✅ Create `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` to exclude build artifacts
3. ✅ Update workflow to use config file
4. ✅ Re-run analysis on the 140 remaining valid alerts
5. ✅ Use updated `SECURITY_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` for the real issues

## Verification

After running the cleanup script, verify the results:

```powershell
# Check current open alert count
gh api /repos/dylan-mccarthy/Scalable-Process-Agent-System/code-scanning/alerts `
  --jq '[.[] | select(.state == "open")] | length'

# Expected: 140 (down from 360)
```

## Questions?

- **Q: Will this delete legitimate security findings?**  
  A: No, the script only dismisses alerts for files that don't exist in the repository.

- **Q: Can I undo the dismissals?**  
  A: Yes, dismissed alerts can be reopened from the GitHub Security tab.

- **Q: Why are Docker images being scanned?**  
  A: Your CI/CD pipeline may be running CodeQL after Docker build. Consider moving CodeQL earlier in the pipeline.
